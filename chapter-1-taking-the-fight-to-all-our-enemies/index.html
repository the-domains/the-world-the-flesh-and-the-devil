trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of the
world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at
work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions
of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind and were by
nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. ~Ephesians 2:1-3</i></b></p><p>I have a confession to
make: I’m a history nerd. I teach American history to sixth graders, and I
often get unduly excited about all the obscure, interesting stories that
probably made your eyes glaze over when you were that age (don’t feel bad for
them, though; history is fun!). I read big tomes about the Civil War just for
the enjoyment of it. And so I’m very tempted, in this book on spiritual
warfare, to draw every illustration from some great battle in history. But
don’t put this book down in disgust, because I promise I’ll try my best to
restrain myself. However, please permit me just one historical illustration
here in the first chapter.</p><p>I particularly love World
War II; I think it’s one of the most fascinating, inspirational episodes in
American history. There’s a reason that your grandparents or great-grandparents
are often called “The Greatest Generation;” the entire nation dedicated all its
blood and treasure to fighting the evils of totalitarianism, and we owe them
our freedom today.</p><p>For nearly half my life,
America has been engaged in the “war on terror,” first in Afghanistan, then
Iraq, and now, at the time of this writing, the Islamic State. But there’s one
particular aspect of World War II that is very different from the war we’re
fighting today. During WWII, the home front was completely engaged in the
struggle that was taking place on distant battlefields. There was rationing and
recycling drives, people planted “victory gardens” to grow food for their
families so that more food could be shipped overseas, wives went to work in the
factories, people bought war bonds. The home front was gladly and fully engaged
in the war effort.</p><p>Now compare that to today’s
war, and you’ll see the difference. America is at war again—our longest war, in
fact. But looking around, you wouldn’t know it. There’s no difference here on
the home front. We’re at war, but we’re living like we’re at peace.</p><p>The Christian life is war.
There is a war going on all around us—and within us— with eternity hanging in
the balance, and yet most of us are walking around like nothing is wrong, like
there is no war and no danger and no enemy. We have been successfully lulled to
sleep by the enemy’s strategies; surrounded by comfort and ease and success and
prosperity, sitting in air conditioned church buildings with padded seats, it’s
easy to think that the Christian life is a gentle stroll instead of an all-out
war. </p><p>And yet the Christian life
really is war. At the end of his life, the apostle Paul summarized his life and
ministry with these words: “I have fought the good fight.” Could we say the
same thing? We have enemies opposed to us—without and within, bent on our
destruction—and yet for most of us, myself included, we're living like it's
peacetime. We don't have a wartime mindset or a wartime lifestyle.</p><p>But the news from this
battlefield is even more sobering than that, because it turns out that in this
war we have more than one enemy; in fact, we have three. The trifecta of what
the Bible calls “the world, the flesh, and the devil” sum up the forces arrayed
against us, bent on derailing our spiritual life, silencing our witness, and
stifling our love and passion for God.</p><p>These three enemies are
seen throughout the New Testament. In Ephesians 2, as Paul is describing our
desperate situation prior to the saving grace of God, he describes how these
three enemies have conspired to work together to keep us in that spiritually
dead condition.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once
walked, following the course of the world, following the prince of the power of
the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom
we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the
body and the mind and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of
mankind.</i></p><p> ~Ephesians 2:1-3</p><p>Do you see the three
enemies mentioned? Prior to God’s converting, awakening grace, we were dead in
our sins, “following the course of the world.” There’s the first enemy: the
world. Like a dead fish that floats with the current, our natural
pre-conversion bent was to go along with the rest of the world, blindly
participating in our culture’s unique rebellions against God. We were satisfied
with worldly possessions, power, and prestige instead of delighting in the God
who gives those things. This is the enemy that Jesus points out in his parable
of the sower; he calls them thorns: “the cares of the world and the
deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the
word, and it proves unfruitful.” That’s worldliness.</p><p>Keep reading Ephesians 2,
and you’ll meet our second enemy in the very next phrase: “following the prince
of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
disobedience.” Paul is referring to Satan here, and what he’s saying is that
our problem is greater than just worldliness; in following the course of the
world, we’re really following the prince of darkness who has authority over
this fallen world. Systems of worldly thought and worldly temptations are
really demonic systems of thought and demonic temptations. That means, on one
hand, that our first enemy is no small potatoes: the allure of worldliness is
owing in large part to Satanic influence. But it also means that we can’t just
focus on worldliness in the struggle for holiness; we also have to recognize
the reality of the demonic and the role that Satan plays in our temptations and
struggles. This enemy also makes an appearance in Jesus’ parable: “These are
the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan
immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.”</p><p>But we can’t just stop with
those two enemies; there is a third in this text as well: “among whom we all
once lived in the passions of our <i>flesh, </i>carrying out the desires of the
body and the mind.” “The flesh” is the New Testament’s term for our sinful
nature; it’s the natural bent of our hearts away from God and towards self-love
and self-rule. We are born as fallen people, and without God’s regenerating grace,
our hearts and minds will never respond to God with the reverence, love, and
obedience that he is due. At the moment of salvation, when God sovereignly
takes the blinders off of our darkened hearts and we first see and respond to
Jesus as beautiful and compelling (2 Corinthians 3:3-6), we are indwelt with
the Holy Spirit and given a new nature that is alive and responsive to God. But
even as Christians, this sinful flesh, this indwelling sin, still remains in
us, and our sinful hearts are constantly tugging us away from God and towards
temptation.</p><p>These are the three enemies
of our souls. Apart from God’s sovereign grace, we have no hope of ever
escaping Ephesians 2:1-3; the triple-team of the world, the flesh, and the
devil make it impossible for us to ever even want to choose to follow Jesus. </p><p>But here’s the question:
once we are saved, and rescued from the damning, dominating effects of the
world, the flesh, and the devil, how do we go about fighting them? The battle
still rages, whether we realize it or not. You may have been rescued from
worldliness, freed from Satan’s clutches, and given a new heart, but
worldliness still allures, Satan still tempts, and your sinful heart still
loves its sin. We need strategies that recognize all three of these enemies,
and engage in the full battle for our souls.</p><p>The reason I’m writing this
book is two-fold: my conviction that everything in the Christian life is
connected to the cross, and my concern that our strategies in this battle are
sorely lacking. </p><p>CROSS-CONNECTED WARFARE</p><p>The first reason is that I
am convinced that the heartbeat of the Christian life, and the primary
motivation that God uses to change us, is the gospel. Over and over again, the
biblical authors draw lines of motivation from the cross to various areas of
our lives. From “we love because he first loved us” to “forgive one another as
God in Christ forgave you” to “husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the
church,” the cross is the engine of the Christian life. The way that God
designed the Christian life to be lived is by plugging every area of our lives
into its power.</p><p>This arena of spiritual
warfare and the fight of sanctification is no different. In fact, each one of
these enemies was decisively defeated at the cross. We’ll unpack the
implications of these verses later, but for now, I just want you to see how the
cross deals with each of our enemies:</p><p>THE WORLD</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
~Galatians 6:14</i></p><p>THE FLESH</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the
body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved
to sin. ~Romans 6:6</i></p><p>THE DEVIL</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>God made us alive together with him, having forgiven us all our
trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its
legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the
rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in
him. ~Colossians 2:13-15</i></p><p>The cross and the gospel are
bigger than just “Jesus died to forgive my sins.” The cross is the decisive
event by which God defeated all three of our enemies and applied that victory
to us. What that means for us, both theologically and practically, is what
we’ll unpack in Part Two and Three.</p><p>EXPANDED BATTLE STRATEGIES</p><p>The second reason I’m
writing this book is that I have been coming to the growing realization that
for most of us—including me—our strategies for fighting the fight of
sanctification are lacking, for the simple reason that we’re not recognizing and
engaging all three of our enemies. Typically, we’re only aware of one at a
time. And because we’re not recognizing how the world, the flesh, and the devil
are all involved in this war, our strategies have only limited success. Could
it be that the reason we’re not seeing more breakthroughs and victories in our
struggle against sin is because we’re only fighting one of our enemies, and not
all three?</p><p>Most churches and
denominations and individual Christians tend to focus on one of our three
enemies. Let’s think through what that looks like. As we briefly examine each
enemy and the pitfalls of focusing on only one of them, think and pray about
which one you tend to gravitate towards.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE WORLD</b></p><p>Some believers, especially
those from particularly conservative backgrounds, tend to focus most of their
sanctification fight on worldliness. To them, worldliness is the main enemy.
Temptation arises from the sinful world and culture around them, and so it is
of the utmost importance in the Christian life to separate yourself from
worldly influences. Don’t watch R-rated movies, don’t listen to secular music,
dress modestly, homeschool your kids.</p><p>Now here’s the thing: to a
great extent, believers who think this way are right. We live in an
increasingly post-Christian, hedonistic, sexually perverted and promiscuous
culture. We are told in no uncertain terms to flee from sexual immorality
(Ephesians 5:3) and that friendship with the world is enmity with God (James
4:4). So to be on guard against all forms of worldliness is commendable. There
is a lot of wisdom in avoiding things that would tempt us or outright cause us
to sin. Modesty is important. The biblical command to train up your children in
the fear and discipline of the Lord leads many parents to prayerfully decide to
homeschool their kids. These are all good things.</p><p>But the pitfall in focusing
on the dangers of worldliness is that we often underestimate our other two
enemies, to our own peril. And Satan is crafty and our hearts are deceitful; it
is way too easy for a good guard against worldliness to turn into being
sheltered, naïve, narrow-minded, legalistic people who have so many external
rules that we can never get past them to reach a culture that is perishing. A
focus on worldliness to the exclusion of our other enemies quickly turns into
an emphasis on externals and performance: don’t wear certain clothes, don’t
listen to certain music, don’t go certain places, don’t smoke or chew or go
with girls who do. Pretty soon our “sanctification” has devolved into the plot
of <i>Footloose, </i>and we’ve deceived ourselves into thinking we’re holy,
when we’re really just Pharisees.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE FLESH</b></p><p>Other groups of Christians,
while certainly not discounting the reality of worldliness, put much more
emphasis on the flesh. Full disclosure: this is the theological pool I swim in,
and I tend to focus on this area of sanctification to the dangerous exclusion
of the other two. This kind of believer has a deep and robust understanding of
the sinful nature. They are the first to assent to the doctrine of total
depravity, and have spent many hours in accountability groups discussing their
heart motives and root idols. They (okay, me) have John Owen’s <i>The
Mortification of Sin </i>on their bookshelf and admire the Puritans for their
deep understanding of the sinfulness of the human heart.</p><p>Just like the first group,
these are all really good things. A sober, biblical view of human nature is a
fount of wisdom, and people who have plumbed the depths of the human heart and
are well acquainted with its deception are some of the wisest, most winsome,
humble people on the planet. But as I survey wider American Christian circles,
I don’t see a lot of this kind of wisdom; I think our view of the sinful nature
is too often weak and shallow and unbiblical. Much of the American church could
use a good dose of the humility and wisdom that comes with emphasizing the role
of the flesh in our temptations and struggles. Especially when this emphasis is
combined with a good grasp on the gospel, a proper understanding and
appreciation for the power of the flesh is a potent weapon for sanctification.
Most of my own growth in godliness has come from seeing the root idols behind
patterns of sin in my life, and most of my counseling and discipleship centers
on getting the gospel down to the root issues in the heart.</p><p>But just like we’ve seen
before, when the role of the flesh is emphasized to the exclusion of our other
enemies, the result is imbalance, weakness, and error. I don’t need to look
farther than my own life to see the fruit of this. How many hours have I spent
soaking in the banality of television, only to be left wondering why my heart
is so cold to the things of God? I spend hours in accountability groups
dissecting the idols in my heart and the lies I unconsciously believe, trying
to get to the heart of my struggle with lust, never realizing that the worldly
entertainment and immodesty that fills my life makes it nearly impossible to
cultivate a heart of purity. And while I can understand all the root issues in
my heart in given areas of sin, I still find myself frustrated and defeated
year after year, never considering that patterns of sin open my heart to
demonic influence and oppression that keep me chained in those same cycles of
sin. Paul made this connection in Ephesians 4: “Do not let the sun go down on
your anger, and give no opportunity for the devil.” Apparently, unresolved
anger opens opportunities for Satan to exploit and oppress. But that never
crosses my mind in accountability; I’m too focused on “getting to the root of
the problem.”</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE DEVIL</b></p><p>Our third enemy, Satan, is
the most polarizing of all our foes. It seems like Christians either act like
the devil doesn’t exist, or live like he’s lurking in every dark corner. These
twin errors shouldn’t surprise us, of course; if Satan is the father of lies
then it makes sense that he would go to great lengths to deceive believers as
to his true power and purpose.</p><p>Christians who emphasize
this third enemy over the other two tend to hail from Pentecostal or
Charismatic camps (although that’s not always the case). These are the
believers who read books on intercessory prayer, attend conferences on
spiritual warfare, and are frequently found praying for deliverance and healing
for themselves and others.</p><p>Just like the other two
groups we’ve looked at, this emphasis has a lot of positives. In many areas of
the church, our knowledge and experience with spiritual warfare is sorely
lacking. Paul said of Satan, “We are not ignorant of his schemes (2 Corinthians
2:11).” How many of us could say that today? Christians who take Satan and
spiritual warfare seriously know what the armor of God is and are well-trained
to obey the biblical command to put it on and take their stand against evil.
Most of the great prayer warriors that I’ve known—saints who are deeply
committed to intercessory prayer—have also been very focused on this enemy. There’s
a reason for that; when you recognize the power, deception, and spiritual
nature of this enemy, you’re pushed to your knees in a more urgent way than the
fight against worldliness and flesh tend to provoke. Believers like this often
have great stories of victory over oppression and miracles of healing. Perhaps
the reason that those sorts of things aren’t seen as much in other corners of
the church is that the rest of us aren’t taking this battle seriously enough.</p><p>But as in everything, a
strong emphasis on Satan and the demonic inevitably leads to error and
imbalance (isn’t it ironic that Satan will use a strong emphasis on his own
power to blind us to the reality of our other enemies!). It seems to me that
many Christians who put a strong emphasis on Satan’s power have a
correspondingly weak understanding of the power of the flesh. In their view,
sin is primarily something that comes from without, through the temptation and
deception of Satan, rather than arising from our own twisted, deceitful hearts.
While the devil does prowl around like a roaring lion, I am much more afraid of
my own sinful heart than I am of him, and I think that’s biblical. But when
Satan is the be-all and end-all of spiritual warfare, every struggle against
sin ends up boiling down to a “pray to claim the power of Jesus” expectation of
victory, rather than rolling up the sleeves for a long, hard, prayerful look at
the condition of our own hearts.</p><p>In addition, an undue
emphasis on Satan tends to cause us to see his activity everywhere, often in
ways that the Bible doesn’t warrant. Recently my 14-month old son was seriously
sick for about a week, and a dear friend who hails from this camp (who is also
a wise, godly saint and fervent prayer warrior) suggested that perhaps the
cause of his sickness was that a spirit of illness had taken up residence in
our home. She gave suggestions as to what sort of strategies work against that
kind of evil spirit. Maybe she was right… or maybe he just had the flu. Either
way, identifying various kinds of spirits and attaching battle strategies to
each of them goes beyond the information that we’re given in God’s Word, and
leaves us with the tendency to see demons under every doily. Don’t get me
wrong; I don’t want to discount the reality of the demonic and Satan’s hand in
our trials. If you don’t think that he’s involved in any of your trials, read
the book of Job and 1 Peter. But not <i>everything </i>is demonic, and even
those things that do have his fingerprints on them can often be effectively
addressed by the amazing grace of medicine as well as the amazing grace of
prayer.</p><p>Jesus himself saw the
difference and used divine discernment to distinguish maladies that were rooted
in the physical from those that were rooted in the spiritual. In Luke 13 he saw
a woman “who had a disabling spirit.” He cast out the demon and she was free
from her crippling paralysis. But many other times when he saw a crippled
person, we’re told he <i>healed </i>them, not that he cast out demons. Jesus
saw the difference, and we should pray for the ability to see the difference
too. I think that sort of wise discernment will grow as we learn to broaden our
understanding of the war and begin to fight all our enemies, not just Satan.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>TAKING THE FIGHT TO ALL OUR
ENEMIES</b></p><p>You can see from these
observations that most Christians tend to emphasize one of our enemies over and
against the other two. You yourself probably fall into one of those three
groups. While there are helpful insights to be gained by understanding each
one, our failure to appreciate and engage in the full scope of the battle
inevitably leads us into defective battle strategies. We need to learn to take
the fight to all our enemies.</p><p>That’s what I’m praying
this book will be useful for. In Part 1, we’ll take some time to better
understand the world, the flesh, and the devil—what they are, and how they are
opposed to our witness and growth in godliness. In Part 2, we’ll celebrate how
each of those enemies were disarmed at the cross and see what that means for
our lives now. And finally, in Part 3 we’ll look to God’s Word for some
practical strategies in fighting each enemy.</p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 data-reactid="30"><a data-reactid="31">Chapter 1- Taking the Fight to All our Enemies</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="35"></div></section></div></div>

But that never\ncrosses my mind in accountability; I’m too focused on “getting to the root of\nthe problem.”"},{"id":"6ea7be61-267c-41b3-8307-c5a471088ef6","item":"c223e9db-2800-45ca-85dc-a559e4d2a9f9","type":"text","html":"<p><b></b></p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]}},{"id":"23608945-cf83-4379-a4d9-0d59e3dbe8d7","item":"c223e9db-2800-45ca-85dc-a559e4d2a9f9","type":"text","html":"<p><b>THE DEVIL</b></p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"THE DEVIL"},{"id":"03c2a12b-74f0-4a89-9dcf-b81dc3b718b4","item":"c223e9db-2800-45ca-85dc-a559e4d2a9f9","type":"text","html":"<p>Our third enemy, Satan, is\nthe most polarizing of all our foes.
