God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. ~Ephesians
6:11</i></b></p><p>Part 1 and Part 2 of this
book each had three chapters dedicated to the world, the flesh, and the devil.
Part 1 laid out a biblical understanding of each of these enemies, so that we
would know them better and engage them more fully. Part 2 showed how each of
these enemies was decisively disarmed at the cross, and that the gospel is the
main weapon we have in our fight. Part 3 is dedicated to some practical
application of these truths, but if you looked at the Table of Contents, you
may have noticed two discrepancies: Part 3 only has two chapters, and we’re
starting with the chapter on the demonic first instead of last.</p><p>The reason for those two
discrepancies is two-fold. First, as you’ll see in the next chapter, the
strategy against worldliness and the flesh is actually one single strategy, one
war waged at the level of desires. And the second reason we’re tackling
practical battle strategies against the demonic first instead of last is
different: I don’t want the last chapter in this book to be about Satan; he
doesn’t deserve that place of honor. The last word in this book, as in all of
life, should be Jesus: his glory, his beauty, his power. I want this book to
end on a note, not of war, but of worship. And so we’re going to reorder this
final section, just to put Satan in his proper place, and exalt Jesus to his
rightful position.</p><p>There are many different
directions we could go with this chapter. We could further explore how Satan
can gain a foothold in your life through things like anger and unforgiveness
(Ephesians 4:26-27). We could flesh out better prayer strategies against the
demonic. But this book can’t be all things to all people, or it will end up
being a thousand pages long. So I will content myself to unpack the central
“marching orders” that we’re given in our fight against the demonic: the “armor
of God” in Ephesians 6. What we’ll find in looking carefully at these battle
strategies is that the call to put on the whole armor of God is nothing more
than a call to equip yourself with the gospel.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Finally, brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of
his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against
the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but
against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over
this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly
places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore,
having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of
righteousness, and as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by
the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with
which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the
helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that
end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,
and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to
proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains,
that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak. ~Ephesians 6:10-20</i></p><p>3 times there in the first
4 verses, Paul reiterates our orders as followers of Christ: stand firm. Did
you see that? Verse 11- “Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
stand.” Verse 13- “Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand,
therefore.”</p><p>Stand! Withstand! Stand
firm! Stand! The repeated insistence of this command tells me that this must be
important. This battle that we are in is not primarily an offensive battle, but
defensive. Victory will be achieved by standing firm, by holding our ground, by
not surrendering or retreating. And to stand firm, we must be properly
equipped- that’s why I want to spend the majority of this chapter just unpacking
the armor that God has given us in this fight.</p><p>THE STRENGTH OF HIS MIGHT</p><p>But I can’t help point out
one thing before we get to the armor. Look at the first command again: "Be
strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of
God." The one who is on our side in this battle is God himself. </p><p>That might seem obvious
again, but stop and let this sink in. The God who made heaven and earth with a
word, the God who sustains the universe by the word of his power, the One who
numbers the stars and the hairs on your head—he is on our side. The infinite,
eternal, omnipotent, Almighty Lord of hosts. The One who spoke, and demons
trembled and obeyed. The One through whom and for whom all things exist.</p><p>Consider what Colossians 1
says about his power. Speaking of Jesus, it says,</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"By him all things were created, in heaven and on earth,
visible and invisible—whether thrones or rulers or authorities—all things were
created through him and for him."</i></p><p>Of all the things to
specifically mention that were created by Jesus and exist for Jesus, Paul says,
"Thrones, rulers, authorities—that is, the rulers, the authorities, the
cosmic powers over this present darkness—even they exist for Jesus and will
serve his glory."</p><p>This battle is not a battle
of equals. This is not a yin-yang duality struggle. On one side you have Satan,
who prowls around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. And on the
other side, the Sovereign Lord of the universe, in whose hand are all things,
including Satan. He is the one who created all things and for whom all things,
including Satan, exist; who disarmed the rulers and authorities on the cross,
who gives us the victory. In 2 Thessalonians 2:8 it says that on the last day,
Jesus will appear to finally do away with the anti-Christ and Satan and all the
forces of evil. And this is how he's going to do it: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord
Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the
appearance of his coming."</i></p><p>Satan goes down with poof—a
breath from the mouth of the Lord Jesus, and all evil is brought to nothing and
annihilated by his appearance. All that Jesus has to do is just show up, and
the brilliance of his glory will scatter darkness forever. That’s just one example
of why, again, I didn’t want to end this book with a word on Satan but with a
word on Jesus. At the end of history, Jesus blows Satan away with an effortless
breath, and then reigns in uncontested glory forever. Satan doesn’t get the
final word; Jesus does. That’s the note I want to end the book on in the next
chapter.</p><p>This is the God who is on
our side. It's breathtaking. Romans 8:31 says, "If God is for us, who can
be against us?" To which we might answer, "Lots of people! Satan is
against me. People are against me." But not successfully. If God is for
us, then no one, not even Satan himself, can be successfully against us.</p><p>In this knowledge, then,
hear verse 10 again: "Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His
might." Whose strength will win the day? God's strength. In spiritual
warfare, in your fight against sin and temptation and darkness, you do not
fight alone. The arm of omnipotence is leveraged in the defense of his people. </p><p>We stand in God's strength,
and we fight in God's battle. This is God's battle, not ours. Reading this
passage on spiritual warfare, I'm reminded of David fighting Goliath. On his
own, he wouldn't stand a chance. But he trusted in God's strength, and knew
that he was fighting God's battle. 1 Samuel 17:47—“This day the Lord will
deliver you into my hand... that all the earth may know that there is a God in
Israel, and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword
and spear, for the battle is the LORD's."</p><p>In Matthew 16, Jesus gave
this spectacular promise: “On this rock I will build my church, and the gates
of hell shall not prevail against it.” Note who is doing the building: Jesus
himself. He is the one building the church that will crush the gates of hell.
And, while we’re on the subject of hell’s gates, consider this: the only reason
that the church will prevail over the gates of hell is because the church’s
Savior blew open those gates from the inside out when he conquered death. This
is his battle. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE ARMOR OF GOD</b></p><p>The strength is the Lord's,
the battle is the Lord's, and the armor is the Lord's too. "Put on the
armor of God." Do you see that? In the same way that this is God’s
strength and God’s battle, this is also God's armor. The phrase "armor of
God" doesn't just mean that this is the armor that God gives to us. This
is God's armor—this is the armor that God wears.</p><p>You see, for us to
understand what these pieces of armor mean and how to apply them and wield
them, we need to understand the imagery. Most of this armor imagery comes from
the Old Testament, and in the Old Testament, it is God himself who wears this
armor. Listen to these texts:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of
salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for his clothing, and
wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak." ~Isaiah 59:17</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and
faithfulness the belt of his loins." ~Isaiah 11:5</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"His faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear
the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day." ~Psalm 91:4-5</i></p><p>And in Revelation, we see
Jesus himself arrayed for battle and wielding the sword of the Spirit: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one
sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and
makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems,
and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a
robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God...
From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations."
~Revelation 19:11-15</i></p><p>This is God's armor. Jesus
wears this armor, and the way we put on this armor is, as Colossians says, to
put on Christ. He is on our side and we are united with him. We are in Christ
and therefore are a part of his battle against evil. Knowing that, we can now
turn our attention to the command to put on his armor.</p><p>THE GOSPEL APPLIED</p><p>Verse 13 says, “Take up the
whole armor of God—or, you might say, ‘all of God's armor’—so that you may be
able to withstand in the evil day." We've seen that this armor is God's
armor, the armor that he himself wears and by which he reigns and makes war. So
what does each piece of the armor mean, and how do we use it? Here's what we're
going to find: each of these pieces of armor is the gospel applied. </p><p>That makes sense, if you
think about what we've seen so far. We don't fight in our own strength and abilities,
but in God's strength. Satan was disarmed and defanged at the cross, where all
our sin was taken away. And this armor is God's armor, not ours. It's all of
God; everything here is of God, God's doing. And so it shouldn't surprise us,
as we start getting into the specifics of the armor, that the gospel—the good
news of what God has done for us—stays central.</p><p>So let's read the whole
list again to get it before us, and then take them one by one:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and
having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for your feet,
having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances
take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming
darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all
prayers and supplication."</i></p><p>BELT OF TRUTH</p><p>First in the list is the
belt of truth. The function of the belt in a soldier's armor was to hold the
uniform together, to hoist everything up and give the soldier mobility. If
you've ever read in the Bible the phrase, "gird up your loins,"
that's "belt" talk. To gird up your loins meant to hoist up your
robes and tie them with a belt so that you could run and move and fight.</p><p>So what does it mean to put
on the belt of truth, to gird up your loins for this fight? I think 1 Peter
1:13 is a perfect description of how the belt of truth functions: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Therefore, girding up the loins of your mind, and being
sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at
the revelation of Jesus Christ."</i></p><p>Gird up the loins of your
mind, fasten the belt of truth, by setting your hope fully on grace. Putting on
the belt of truth means getting the truth of the gospel in front of you and
anchoring your hope there. Take the hope of grace and set your mind there. Just
like a belt holds the rest of the armor together, this holds the rest of God's
armor together.</p><p>Practically, that means
memorizing gospel texts, reciting gospel truths to yourself, preaching the
gospel to yourself, living your life at the foot of the cross where your record
of debt was nailed and Satan's accusations were disarmed. Satan’s accusations
and condemnations seem true, until you stand at the cross and see the record of
your debt nailed there. Then you can know the truth: my feelings of
condemnation are a lie. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ
Jesus (Romans 8:1). Because of grace, I can repent and move on with
thankfulness and increased humility.</p><p>THE BREASTPLATE OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS</p><p>Next comes the breastplate
of righteousness. To see the gospel connection here, all we need to do is ask a
simple question: whose righteousness is this? Whose righteousness am I supposed
to arm myself with? My own? Or his? We know from Romans 4-5 that we are clothed
in the righteousness of Christ—that his obedience is credited to us. I do think
that's exactly the righteousness in mind here, because remember whose armor this
is: God's armor! This is God's righteousness. Remember Isaiah 59:17—“<i>He </i>put on righteousness as a breastplate." The righteousness of Christ is our
breastplate, protecting us against all the accusations of Satan. No accusation
will ever stick against those whom God has justified, because the obedience of
Jesus is ours.</p><p>So what does this look like
practically? Isaiah 61:10 is a good place to start:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in
my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me
with the robe of righteousness."</i></p><p>To put on the breastplate
of righteousness means to train your heart to thrill and rejoice and exult in
the gospel. There is no room for Satan's temptations and accusations in a heart
overflowing with gladness in grace.</p><p>SHOES</p><p>Next, "as shoes for
your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace." This
is an allusion to Isaiah 52:7: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings
good news- gospel- who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who
publishes salvation, who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”</i></p><p>Do you see the progression
so far in the armor? Gird up the loins of your mind, setting your mind on the
hope of grace. Then fill your heart with the joy of justification. And now, put
that gospel on your feet and bring it to others. Satan is undone and defeated
when the gospel of peace moves from our heads to our hearts to our feet, and we
lay down our lives to cross mountains and cross the street with the testimony
of God's grace in our lives. That's what Revelation 12:11 says- "The
saints have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their
testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death." When the blood
of the Lamb is tracked across the world by fearless disciples who articulate
the gospel in their testimonies, Satan doesn’t stand a chance.</p><p>SHIELD OF FAITH</p><p>Next is the shield of
faith. "In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you
can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one." Peter identifies
these "flaming darts of the evil one" as "fiery trials"
which the devil, who prowls around like a roaring lion, seeks to leverage to
your destruction. And the antidote? Faith. Faith protects us, guards our
hearts, and helps us persevere through trials.</p><p>But I want some more
concrete application here. So... faith in what, specifically? I think it's
really interesting that in Ephesians 6, it says the shield of faith guards
against the arrows of the evil one, and in Psalm 91 it says, "His
faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear the terror of the
night; nor the arrow that flies by day." In Ephesians 6 the shield is </p><p><i>our </i>faith. And in Psalm 91 the shield is</p><p><i>his </i>faithfulness. It's the exact
same imagery; it's probably the imagery that Paul is drawing on. Here's what I
infer from that: our faith is in his faithfulness. Our trust is in his ability
and commitment to keep his promises. Peter says, "Let those who suffer
according to God's will entrust their souls to their faithful Creator."
That faith in his faithfulness takes every circumstance, every fiery trial, and
sees that it is suffering according to God's will. That faith in his
faithfulness extinguishes all the enemy's designs in your suffering.</p><p>HELMET OF SALVATION</p><p>Next, the helmet of
salvation. In 1 Thessalonians 5:8, Paul gives another, shorter list of God's
armor, and there he says, "Put on for a helmet the hope of
salvation." That sounds, again, a lot like 1 Peter 1:13—“set your hope
fully on grace." Put on the helmet of salvation's hope; set your mind on
grace, fix your mind on things in heaven, where Christ is, seated at the right
hand of God. Fill your thoughts with eternity, with grace, with Jesus. Soak
your mind in God's Word until, as the battle hymn “Be Thou My Vision” says, he
is your "best thought by day or by night."</p><p>THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT</p><p>The next object in our
arsenal is the sword of the Spirit, the only offensive weapon in this list.
This imagery of the Word of God being like a sword is found throughout the
Bible. I love how Hebrews 4:12 puts it: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"The Word of God is living and active, sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and
marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</i></p><p>That verse shows us the
first surprising way that the sword of the Spirit functions in spiritual
warfare: by making war on us. Did you see that? "Sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the
heart." The Word of God is like a battlefield medic, removing the bullet
of sin, amputating the hand that causes us to sin. God's Word is a sword for
surgery on our own treasonous hearts. </p><p>In fact, before the sword
of the Spirit can attack Satan, it must attack us first. Ephesians 4:26 says,
“Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the
devil.” The only room that Satan has to gain a foothold in the believer’s life
is through unrepentant sin. If, for example, you persist in anger and
unforgiveness, your heart is an open door for the demonic to take the reins of
your sinful desires and strengthen them into chains of oppression and bondage.
Some of the persistent patterns of sin in your life—those things that you have
struggled with and prayed about for years but can’t seem to break free of—may
run deeper and stronger than mere idols and fleshly desires. These things may
require a deeper, closer level of heart examination, prayer, and repentance.
Where does that start? It starts with the weapon “sharper than two-edged sword,
piercing and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” We need the
word of God, often wielded in the gentle hands of our brothers and sisters, to
probe our motives and sins and reveal where Satan may have taken a foothold.
Only then can the Spirit’s sword be turned from surgical sword against us to
offensive weapon against the demonic.</p><p>The second way the sword of
the Spirit works is how we see Jesus using it in his dealings with Satan. Satan
kept tempting him, and he kept responding with Bible (Matthew 4). Truth is a
powerful weapon against the deceitfulness of sin and the alluring power of
temptation. So know your Bible, and know your heart. Know what temptations you
struggle with, and arm yourself with God's words, God's weapons. </p><p>PRAYER</p><p>And lastly, prayer. We
often don't think of this one when we think of the armor of God, but it's here.
In fact, this is the most important one practically, because the very
grammatical structure of this list tells us that prayer is essential to every
one of these pieces of armor. It's a participle coming at the end of the list-
"praying at all times in the Spirit." That means that it modifies
each of the phrases that came before it: Fasten the belt of truth, praying at
all times in the Spirit. Put on the breastplate of righteousness, praying at
all times in the Spirit. Take up the shield of faith, praying at all times in
the Spirit. Take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, praying
at all times in the Spirit. </p><p>This is the practical
outworking of each piece of armor. We gird up the loins of our mind and set our
minds on grace, not just with Bible verses, but with prayer. We rejoice in the
gospel of Christ's righteousness by prayer. We use the word of God on our
hearts and in defense of temptation prayerfully. </p><p>Prayer should characterize
all of our lives. Look at how all-consuming and expansive wartime prayer should
be: "praying at ALL times...with ALL prayer... with ALL perseverance for
ALL the saints." Do you get the picture? Prayer is the urgent,
all-consuming voice of spiritual warfare. The Puritan theologian Jonathan
Edwards once said, “The one concern of the devil is to keep the saints from
prayer. He fears nothing from prayerless studies, prayerless work, prayerless
religion. He laughs at our toil, he mocks at our wisdom, but he trembles when
we pray.”</p><p>Why? It is because prayer
is how we appropriate the omnipotent strength of the Lord’s might in this
fight. Prayer moves us beyond our simple strategies and calls in the Almighty’s
firepower. Prayer is asking him for his strength, his grace, his joy, his
peace, his truth. A good way to test yourself as to how much you are relying on
God is simply by asking: how much are you praying?</p><p>You see, prayer is our
wartime walkie-talkie. John Piper said something great about this: "Prayer
is a wartime walkie talkie for spiritual warfare, not a domestic intercom to
increase the comforts of the saints." One of the reasons we are so prayerless
is because we think of prayer as a domestic intercom to summon our heavenly
butler, instead of the wartime walkie talkie that it really is. We feel pretty
comfortable and secure, and we’ve got plenty of money and resources to
accumulate the comforts we want… and so, honestly, we just don’t see much
urgent need for prayer.</p><p>But life is war. This world
is not our home; we don’t live on the home front, but rather on the front lines
of the battle. We’ve been slumbering in the trenches for too long, trying to

It starts with the weapon “sharper than two-edged sword,\npiercing and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” We need the\nword of God, often wielded in the gentle hands of our brothers and sisters, to\nprobe our motives and sins and reveal where Satan may have taken a foothold.\nOnly then can the Spirit’s sword be turned from surgical sword against us to\noffensive weapon against the demonic.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"6c622961-2770-4e28-8f5c-291189570493","item":"36e9b2b4-3a1d-4def-b862-76a2f7239e2f","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"The second way the sword of\nthe Spirit works is how we see Jesus using it in his dealings with Satan.
