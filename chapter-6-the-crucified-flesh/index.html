was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to
nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. ~Romans 6:6</i></b></p><p>There’s a strange phrase
that appears over and over again in the New Testament. It’s so ubiquitous that
you might have never really noticed it, let alone spent time dwelling on its
significance and power. It’s the phrase “in Christ.” That specific phrase
appears 83 times in the writings of Paul, and when you include its equivalents
like “in him” or “in the Lord,” it’s there a whopping 216 times! It’s on every
page of Paul’s writings, over and over and over again. Consider these few
examples, all taken from the short letter of Ephesians:</p><p>Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us <i>in Christ </i>with every
spiritual blessing in the heavenly places. ~Ephesians 1:3</p><p>He chose us <i>in him </i>before the foundation of the world. ~Ephesians 1:4</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>In him </i>we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our
trespasses. ~Ephesians 1:5</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>In him </i>we have obtained an inheritance. ~Ephesians 1:11</p><p>He raised us up <i>with him </i>and seated us <i>with him </i>in the heavenly places <i>in Christ Jesus, </i>so
that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in
kindness towards us <i>in Christ Jesus.</i> ~Ephesians 2:6-7</p><p>We are his workmanship,
created <i>in Christ Jesus </i>for good works. ~Ephesians 2:10</p><p>But now <i>in Christ Jesus </i>you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
~Ephesians 2:13</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>In him </i>you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God
by the Spirit. ~Ephesians 2:22</p><p>Be kind to one another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another as God <i>in Christ </i>forgave you.
~Ephesians 4:32</p><p>It’s everywhere! This is
one of the most pervasive themes of the New Testament. In the opening paragraph
of Ephesians alone, Paul says that we are blessed in Christ, chosen in Christ,
redeemed in Christ, given an inheritance in Christ, and sealed by the Holy
Spirit in Christ. In the rest of the letter, he talks about how we were raised
with Christ, seated in Christ, recreated in Christ, brought near in Christ,
built into a dwelling place for God in Christ, forgiven in Christ, and more.
Every aspect of the Christian life can only be understood in relation to this
massive, mysterious truth: we are <i>in Christ.</i></p><p>And yet, what exactly does
that mean? If you’re anything like me, you probably just skim over those words
when you read them, not giving them much thought. When I read 2 Corinthians
5:17—“If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation”—I usually just skip to the
second part and think about what it means to be a new creation, instead of
considering the foundational condition in the first part: “if anyone is in
Christ.” The only way to be a new creation is to be in Christ. But what does
that mean?</p><p>UNION WITH OUR
REPRESENTATIVE</p><p>Remember back in chapter 3,
when uncovering the origins of the flesh, we looked at Romans 5:12-21 to see a
surprising truth? We are not, most fundamentally, individuals, but have been
created by God to be united to one representative. God created the human race
to be—in some mysterious yet very real way—united together and represented
before him by one man. That original representative was Adam, and Romans 5
explains that because Adam represented everyone united to him (all humanity),
his actions counted for them. By virtue of your humanity, you come into this
world united to your representative, Adam. God credits the actions of your
representative, and the consequences of those actions, to you. When Adam ate
the fruit, you ate the fruit <i>in him. </i>When Adam received the sentence of
spiritual death, you received the the sentence of spiritual death <i>in him.
</i>The power of sin and the allurement of the world usurped God from the throne of
Adam’s heart, and therefore usurped the throne of your heart <i>in him.
</i>That’s why 1 Corinthians 15:22 says simply, “In Adam all die.”</p><p>The incredible good news
that we saw back in chapter 3, however, is that God in his great wisdom so
constituted the human race so that the very thing that was our downfall was
turned around to be the means of our rescue. Jesus became a man in order to be
the new representative for a new human race: all who would be united to him by
faith. And in the same way that Adam’s disobedience was credited to you—even
though you didn’t do it—and you reaped both the eternal consequence of that sin
and its daily power in your life; so also Jesus’ perfect obedience was credited
to you—even though you didn’t do it—and now you reap both the eternal
consequences of that obedience and its daily power in your life. When Jesus
resisted and overcame Satan’s temptations in the wilderness, you resisted and
overcame Satan’s temptations <i>in him. </i>When Jesus perfectly honored his
Father and obeyed him completely, you perfectly honored the Father <i>in him.</i>
That’s why the Bible speaks of being justified—declared righteous—<i>in Christ;</i></p><p>because he is your representative, his obedience counts as your obedience.
And when Jesus paid the penalty of death for sin, you paid the penalty of death <i>in him. </i>That’s why the Bible speaks of being forgiven and reconciled and
redeemed <i>in Christ;</i></p><p>because he is your representative, his payment
counts as your payment. When he paid sin’s penalty perfectly, once for all, God
marked your account as “paid in full.”</p><p>You can see, then, that the
doctrine of union with Christ is not just theoretical or theological. This
isn’t an ivory tower, esoteric discussion; this is the heart of the gospel.
This is the only basis of your acceptance before God: everything Jesus did
counts for you. Think for a moment of the practical implications of that truth,
if you really start to see it in Scripture and believe it.</p><p>When you stumble into that
same pattern of sin for the ten thousandth time, you are secure in the love and
favor of your Father because <i>Jesus never stumbled. </i>The Father considers
Jesus’ obedience as counting for you. And he will not hold you accountable for
your failure, because he considers it already paid for, because Jesus’ payment
counts for you. That means you can boldly approach the throne of grace with
confidence to ask for mercy and help (Hebrews 4:16). You don’t have to hesitate
and cower like the prodigal son; you don’t have to run away and hide from him
like Adam and Eve. You are accepted and beloved and righteous every moment of
every day, because Jesus never sinned, and in him, you’re just as righteous as
he is.</p><p>And conversely, on your
best days—the days when you’ve had an hour-long quiet time and prayed for every
family member and nation of the wold and shared the gospel with three people
and said kind, humble things all day long—you have not added one brick to the
foundation of your acceptance before God. You are still accepted only on the
basis of Jesus’ perfect obedience counting for you. And that’s good news,
because your best prayers were shot through with doubts, and all your kind,
humble deeds were polluted with mixed motives, and you still sinned a thousand
times in thought and action. Your obedience doesn’t make you any more secure
than your disobedience makes you insecure. Your security, your foundation, is
Jesus Christ and him alone. He is your righteousness, he is your payment for
sin, and every moment of every day you can confidently say, “I am forgiven and
accepted and beloved and righteous <i>in him.”</i></p><p>We must get this—really <i>get</i></p><p>this, deep down in our hearts—if we are to live in the confidence and
freedom that the gospel offers us. Fight to see this in the Word, pray for
faith to truly believe it, and start venturing more and more of your hope onto
the solid rock and firm foundation of your representative’s perfect obedience. </p><p>There’s an important reason
why I’m lingering on this doctrine, here in this chapter on the gospel and the
flesh. It’s because, after uncovering the origins of the flesh in Romans 5,
this is exactly where Paul goes in Romans 6. We’re about to see that the war on
the sinful flesh can only be waged from this platform: everything Jesus did
counts for me. </p><p>CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</p><p>By the time that Paul has
finished up with Romans 5, he has so highly exalted grace and made such a big
deal of our acceptance before God apart from anything we do, that the question
naturally arises, “Well then, does it matter at all what we do? If God forgives
sin, should we go and throw a big sin party?” Paul’s answer to that question is
a resounding no, but he goes about answering it by extending his argument about
our union with Christ: because Jesus’ perfect obedience was credited to you,
you don’t just reap the eternal consequences of his obedience, you also reap
its sin-conquering power in your daily life. Because everything Jesus did
counts for you, his death to sin was your death to sin, and his resurrection to
new life was your resurrection to new life.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace
may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you
not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized
into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in
order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
we too might walk in newness of life. ~Romans 6:1-4</i></p><p>Paul’s argument here
extends our union with Christ and makes it the foundation not just of our
justification, but our sanctification as well. He says that our old self was
crucified with Jesus, not just so that we wouldn’t bear its condemnation
anymore, but also in order that the power and presence of sin might be
decisively defeated, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. We can say
truly that Jesus died for us on the cross, but Paul wants us to see something
else, even more mysterious and wonderful. The good news of the gospel isn’t
just that Jesus died for you on the cross; it’s that when Jesus died, <i>you</i></p><p>died
too. You were there on the cross too, because Jesus is your representative.
“Our old self was crucified with him.” That’s why God can look at you and
reckon your sins forgiven: the punishment for sin is death, and on the cross,
you died. That’s why Paul stresses that you were baptized—joined—into Jesus’
death; that’s another way of saying, “You have been included in his death in
such a way that when it happened to him, it happened to you.” The punishment
has already been handed down; the payment has already been made in full.</p><p>This is the reality that
Paul talks about in Galatians 2:20- “I have been crucified with Christ. It is
no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in
the body I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for
me.” I was executed on the cross, Paul says, and my life now is a life of union
by faith with the Savior who loved me and gave himself for me. In Colossians
3:3, Paul says it this way: “You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ
in God.” My old self is no longer my identity; my identity is now wrapped up in
Jesus.</p><p>What, exactly, does it mean
that “our old self” died with Jesus on the cross? Obviously, in one sense you
weren’t actually there—you weren’t born yet. And yet that’s not an obstacle for
a God who “inhabits eternity” (Isaiah 57:15) and invented time. If it can be
truly said that we sinned in Adam, it is just as easy to say that we died to
sin in Christ. 2 Timothy 1:9 says that God gave us his grace “in Christ Jesus
before the ages began.” From eternity past, God planned to include you in
Jesus’ death, and to execute your punishment there. And so, on that dark day in
33 AD, God took your old self—the human nature that was united with Adam and
credited with the damning consequences and enslaving power of his sin—and
nailed it to the cross there. The punishment that you were owed because of
Adam’s sin was paid in full. </p><p>But the reality of our
union with Christ is even bigger than that, and the truth that our old self was
nailed to the cross with Jesus has massive implications for our struggle with
the flesh today. Verse 2 puts it like this: “How can we who died to sin still
live in it?” We have been joined to Jesus (that’s the reality which baptism
pictures) in such a way that his power of over sin and death has become <i>our </i>power over sin and death: “Just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory
of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.” That newness of life is
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who has given you a new, tender heart that
is responsive to God and has the power to say “no” to sin and “yes” to God.” By
virtue of Jesus’ resurrection power over sin, you now have the ability, in him,
to say “no” to the sinful desires of your flesh, and “yes” to everything that
God is for you in Jesus.</p><p>ALREADY… NOT YET</p><p>But this is where it gets
tricky: to what extent is that newness of life ours <i>now? </i>Paul says that
“our old self was crucified with him… so that we might no longer be enslaved to
sin.” I don’t know about you, but I still often <i>feel</i></p><p>enslaved to sin. If
I have power to say “no” to sin, why do I still find myself saying “yes” so
often? I sympathize with what Paul says in the next chapter, Romans 7: “I don’t
understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing
I hate… For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I
keep on doing.” Why? If my old self was crucified with Christ, doesn’t that
mean it’s dead and gone? Why do I still feel like it’s alive and kicking? Did
my old self somehow survive the crucifixion?</p><p>That’s where Paul goes next
in his application of this doctrine of union with Christ. After saying that our
union with Jesus enables us to walk in newness of life, he continues in verse 5
with an important clarification: the fullness of this redemption comes in
stages.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>…We too might walk in newness of life. For (because) if we have
been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him
in a resurrection like his.</i></p><p>Paul is making a profound
argument here. We have the ability to walk in newness of life now <i>because,</i>
just like we were united with Jesus’ death, we shall certainly one day be
united with him in his resurrection. One has already happened; one hasn’t taken
place yet. You can see that in the verb tenses of verse 5: “We <i>have been </i>united with him in a death like his… we <i>shall </i>certainly be united with
him in a resurrection like his.” One has already happened; the other has not
yet fully materialized. And right now we are stuck in the middle between the
already and the not yet. But the power to live free now flows from the
certainty of that future event.</p><p>The whole Christian life is
lived in this tension between the already and the not yet. On one hand, we have
already been declared righteous; but we are not yet perfected and fully
conformed to that judgment (Hebrews 10:14). We are already children of God; but
we are not yet reigning with Christ in the full enjoyment of that title (1 John
3:2). We have already been given an inheritance; but we have not yet taken
possession of it (Ephesians 1:14). And while we have already been crucified
with Christ, we have not yet experienced the fullness of resurrection life like
Jesus has (1 Corinthians 15:52). We have a taste of it now, as Romans 6:4
affirms—we walk in newness of life, indwelt by the Holy Spirit—but full freedom
from death and sin is not quite ours yet.</p><p>CONSIDER YOURSELVES DEAD</p><p>But what does that mean for
us now, today? I think Paul’s answer to that can be summarized like this: our
“already-happened” death with Christ decisively broke sin’s power, and the way
we appropriate that power in our lives today is by banking on the certainty of
our “not-yet” resurrection with him. Your experience of “newness of life” and
power to say “no” to sinful desires rises and falls in proportion to your firm
anticipation of your future resurrection. Let’s look at the next couple verses:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the
body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved
to sin. For the one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have
died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that
Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has
dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the
life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin
and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</i></p><p>“The one who has
died”—that’s you, by virtue of your union with Jesus—“has been set free from
sin.” But in the next sentence, there’s the already/not yet tension again: “If
we <i>have </i>died with Christ, we believe that we <i>will</i></p><p>also live with
him.” We’ve died and have been set free from sin, but aren’t yet alive in the
same way that Jesus currently is. We’re still lugging around what Romans 7
calls “this body of death.” Sin’s power has been broken, but its still clinging
to us, wrapped up in our bodies down to the level of our DNA. The antidote has
been administered, but the poison is still circulating in our veins. Our sinful
nature has been nailed to the cross, but it’s still kicking and whispering and
cajoling us to join in its suicidal desires.</p><p>But in the middle of this
already/not yet tension, Paul injects a note of hopeful certainty on which your
entire life hangs: Jesus is currently living in the fullness of his
resurrection life, and soon you will too. Verses 9-10: “We know that Christ,
being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion
over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he
lives he lives to God.” We can have absolute confidence that Jesus’
resurrection did not fail; death has no dominion over him, and he is removed
from all effects of sin and enjoying the presence of his Father forever. And
that’s the guarantee we have that one day our fight with sin will be over: “we
believe that we will also live with him.” Jesus won the battle in his
resurrection, and because we were united with him in his death, one day we will
share that victory too. </p><p>Look at the emphasis Paul
puts on our faith and certainty. “If we have died with Christ, we <i>believe</i></p><p>that
we will also live with him. We <i>know</i></p><p>that Christ, being raised from the
dead, will never die again.” This hopeful certainty is the present-day power of
our future resurrection. The poison of sin is still circulating in your veins,
but to the extent you anticipate the antidote’s power, the antidote begins
working now. Your hopeful certainty <i>is </i>the antidote’s present power.</p><p>We can see that in the way
Paul describes Jesus’ resurrection life now, and what that has to do with our
flesh. Paul describes Jesus’ resurrection life in verse 10: “the death he died
he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.” Note that
Paul didn’t say that Jesus died “for sin” (although that’s certainly true). He
said that Jesus died “to sin.” When Paul says that Jesus “died to sin,” he
means that all of sin’s effects are gone from Jesus forever. He is no longer
subject to any temptation, and will never experience any of the consequences of
sin again. Of course, he never experienced consequences of <i>his </i>sin,
because he didn’t have any—but he did experience the consequences of <i>your </i>sin, and he was tempted in every way that you are. But now he has died to sin;
on the cross, he took all of it on himself, brought it down to the grave, and
left it there. And now that he is in heaven in the presence of his Father, “the
life he lives, he lives to God.” That means he is fully focused on and
committed to his Father’s glory and purposes above all else. All his life and
power today is bent on completing his Father’s agenda.</p><p>That’s what Jesus’ life in
heaven is like now. And—here’s the crucial connection—one day, that’s what your
life will be like too. That’s the connection that Paul made in verse 5: “If we
have been united with him in a death like his, we shall <i>certainly </i>be
united with him in a resurrection like his.” One day, all the effects and
temptations and consequences of sin will be removed from you permanently, and
you will finally be free to fully focus on the Father’s glory and purposes
forever. That’s what heaven is for the believer: final release from every trace
of remaining sin and freedom to joyfully pursue God unhindered forever. You are
nearer to that reality today than you were yesterday; every day moves you
closer to the finish line. Philippians 3:20-21 highlights this guarantee in
both its “already” and “not yet” dimensions: “Our citizenship is in heaven, and
from it we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform
our lowly body to be like his glorious body.” Today, by virtue of our union
with Jesus’ death and resurrection, our slavery to sin is broken and our
citizenship is now in heaven, and we look forward with eager anticipation to
finally participating in the fullness of Jesus’ resurrection life. And it is in
that eager anticipation that we find victory over the flesh in the meantime.</p><p>That’s why the way Paul
makes his conclusion in verse 11 is so important: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>He died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to
God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in
Christ Jesus</i>.</p><p>That resurrection is your
certain future, so day by day live in the good of that future victory. He died
to sin and is free from all its tangling effects; so you reckon yourself
similarly dead to its effects. He is alive to God and fully focused on his
Father’s purposes; so you likewise fix your mind on things that are above and
focus on the Father’s purposes.</p><p>God has said that these
things are already true of you—in Ephesians and Colossians he says that “you <i>have </i>been raised up with Christ”—and even though you aren’t standing there yet, the
secret to victory over the flesh is to live like that’s true. This doesn’t mean
that the Christian life is some kind of mind game, an easy “believe it and it’s
true” scheme. No, it’s a lot harder than that; it’s the call to trust what God
says more than you trust what you feel, because what he says is more real than
your feelings. The resurrection life of Jesus is yours now and will be yours
fully soon, so today, live like it. When your flesh whispers for you to give
into a temptation, say to your soul, “No, that desire is crucified with Christ
and no longer has any claim on me. I am alive to God and, by his grace, fixed
on his purposes. I don’t have to obey that desire anymore; I have better things
to live for.”</p><p>SET YOUR MIND ON THINGS
ABOVE</p><p>That’s the complicated yet
life-changing argument of Romans 6. If Paul’s words have left your head
spinning, don’t worry: I feel that way too. Living today with a radically
future-oriented faith is a difficult thing to understand, let alone accomplish.
So I want to end this chapter in Colossians 3, where this same flow of argument
is condensed and practically applied:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are
above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on
things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and
your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears,
then you also will appear with him in glory. Put to death, therefore, what is
earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and
covetousness, which is idolatry. ~Colossians 3:1-5</i></p><p>Do you see how the same
flow of logic from Romans 6 is working here in Colossians 3? You are united to
Jesus’ death and resurrection; therefore set your mind and attention and
pursuit on heavenly things, where Christ is reigning in the fullness of his
resurrection life. Do this, verse 3 says, <i>because </i>you have died with
Christ, and your life is now wrapped up with him. Wait with eager anticipation
for your own resurrection life to appear (verse 4), and in the meantime, in
light of that coming glory, put to death all those earthly desires of your
flesh. Put to death what has already been executed at the cross of Christ.
Those earthly desires were crucified with Christ; so instead of listening to
them cajoling you from the cross, take the sword of the Spirit—the promises of
God—and run them through with its blade, and do not let them distract you from
“seeking the things that are above” where your resurrection life is waiting for
you.</p><p>In chapter 9 we will
further unpack what this means practically; how, in the words of Romans 8:13,
to “by the Spirit put to death the deeds of the flesh.”</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Holy Spirit, Increase my faith and help
me to set my mind on things above. Help me to truly look forward to my ultimate
union with Jesus, to long for my inheritance, to eagerly anticipate my full
citizenship in heaven. And then help me, in the power of that anticipation, to
put to death everything earthly that remains in me. </i></p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="22"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="24"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="25"><span data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><h2 data-reactid="28"><a data-reactid="29">The World, The Flesh, and the Devil</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="32"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="33"></div></section></div></div>
