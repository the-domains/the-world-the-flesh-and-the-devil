except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been
crucified to me, and I to the world. ~Galatians 6:14</i></b></p><p>Worldliness is any
thinking, feeling, or doing in which God is absent—any pursuit that does not
have God as its North Star and central frame of reference. With that
devastatingly broad definition, how would you evaluate yourself? How did you do
in the weed-whacking evaluation at the end of chapter 2? Jesus diagnosed those
weeds of worldliness in Mark 4:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>They are the ones who hear the word, but the cares of the world
and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and
choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</i></p><p>That phrase “cares of the
world” is particularly freighted with meaning that points to the absence of God
as the central characteristic of worldliness. It comes from the Greek word
“merimna,” which means care, worry, or anxiety. That seems simple enough; these
are the weeds of worry that choke the gospel word and make it unfruitful. But
it actually goes deeper than that. The root of this Greek word “merimna” has
the idea of being pulled in two different directions at the same time; it’s
often translated as “distraction.” The particular type of worry that Jesus has
in mind is the kind of worry that distracts from kingdom building and fruit
producing. It’s a worry that is overly drawn to concerns and agendas, pulling
you away from higher concerns and agendas. Jesus gently cautioned against this
kind of worldly anxiety which distracts from kingdom causes in Matthew 6, when
he said, </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Do not be anxious, saying “What shall we eat?” or “What shall we
drink?” or “What shall we wear?” For the Gentiles seek after all these things,
and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the
kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to
you.</i></p><p>It is not worldly to want
something to eat, drink, or wear. Your Father knows you need all those things
and delights to provide them for you out of the riches of his kindness to you
in Christ. What <i>is </i>worldly is for those material needs and desires to
distract you from what is of first importance. Note that Jesus doesn’t say
“Don’t seek those things.” He says, “Don’t seek them <i>first. Seek </i><i>first</i></p><p>God’s kingdom and righteousness.” When God and his purposes are your
highest priority—your North Star and central frame of reference—then every
other concern finds its place in relation to him. </p><p>A good way to visualize
this is to picture the solar system. When Jesus Christ is the sun at the center
of the solar system of your life—his gravity and glory holding everything else
in place—then every planet of desire and duty finds its proper orbit around
him. But worldliness is when he is removed from the center and replaced with
stuff, even good and necessary things. Just imagine if the earth suddenly
replaced the sun at the center of the solar system; without the sun’s gravity
holding every planet in place, the entire solar system would spin into chaos.
In the same way, the things of this world are not weighty enough to hold the
center, and when they displace Jesus, everything else starts spinning out of
control. Worldliness is God displaced from the center, and every sorrow and sin
is the outworking of the chaos unleashed by that exchange. </p><p>So the great and urgent
question before us is, How do we keep God at the center? With so many things
vying for our attention and affection, the fight against worldliness is a
never-ending struggle to keep my sinful heart from giving into the distractions
that pull me away from him.</p><p>I believe that the solution
to worldliness is not ultimately found in self-denial (saying “no” to worldly
things), although that certainly plays a part. Neither is it as simple as just
trying harder. No amount of mustered willpower can overcome the fatal
attraction that our hearts have to “the cares of the world, the deceitfulness
of riches, and the desire for other things.” The only thing that can break the
allurement of the world is the allurement of something better. The only thing
that can overcome the “gravity” of worldliness is to behold a superior gravity,
superior glory, superior greatness.</p><p>BOASTING IN THE CROSS</p><p>In the book of Galatians,
Paul spends six chapters unpacking the gospel as the free gift of righteousness
and acceptance that comes to us through the costly sacrifice of God’s Son. We
can’t add to what he’s done with our good works or religious duties; we can
only receive it by trusting his finished work. In this gospel is full and
glorious freedom—freedom from law and duty and worldliness and sin and death.
At the very end of his letter to the Galatians, Paul summarizes his whole
letter with one profound sentence that cuts to the very heart of worldliness,
and shows us the only path to victory against this enemy:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by which the world was crucified to me, and I to the world. ~Galatians
6:14</i></p><p>When he says, “Far be it
from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,” what he means
is this: My only glory, my highest joy, the center of my solar system, is the
cross of Jesus. His death on my behalf is the gravity that holds my life
together and the glory that outshines every other boast I could possibly make.</p><p>That’s why he continues his
sentence. Think of all the things he could say about the cross of Jesus: “the
cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which all my sins were forgiven;” “the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which my eternal life was won;” “the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by which the wrath of God was extinguished.” Those are all
true, but are secondary to the point he wants to make, namely, that the cross
of Christ is the center of his life and his highest joy. And so he continues
his sentence by highlighting the most unexpected thing about the cross: it is
the instrument by which the world’s power of allurement was decisively broken
in his life. “The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>by which the world was
crucified to me, and I to the world.”</i></p><p>When Paul says that the
cross is the instrument by which the world was crucified to him and he to the
world, he means that the distracting, alluring, pleasurable pull of the world
was decisively severed; the weeds of worldliness have been pulled up by their
roots. Think of this in terms of Jesus’ parable in Mark 4: the “cares of the
world” no longer pull him away from God’s purposes; the “deceitfulness of
riches” no longer tempt with their empty promises of happiness and security;
and the “desire for other things” has been replaced with a greater desire, a
yearning that he articulates in Philippians 3:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing
Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and
count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ... ~Philippians 3:7-8</i></p><p>How did this happen? Like
this: when Paul thought of the cross and considered the Prince of glory
suffering in the place of a guilty sinner like himself, he was so broken by the
great cost and moved by the great love that he exclaimed, “I will surrender
everything in pursuit of knowing this great Savior more! Whatever it costs,
knowing him is worth it! Compared to everything I used to love and pursue, he
is surpassing worth and gain!” Therein is the secret to victory over worldliness.
A heart that sees Christ like that is a heart freed from the allurement of
worldliness by the sight of superior glory.</p><p>This is how the human heart
works; we are, like moths to a flame, irresistibly drawn to the brightest
beauty we see. In every area of your life, even in the mundane things, you are
constantly desiring and pursuing what you perceive to be the best glory, until
that glory is displaced by something better. As a kid, I used to love Tootsie
rolls. I eagerly desired Tootsie rolls… until I discovered the superior glory
of Ghirardelli chocolate. Once I had tasted what gourmet chocolate tasted like,
the comparatively bland and plasticky taste of Tootsie rolls lost all their
power to tempt me. As a college student, I used to appreciate the utilitarian
value of any cheap cup of coffee; the lukewarm gas station swill was good
enough as long as it would keep me awake (I just had to add enough cream and
sugar). But then, on my honeymoon in Hawaii, my eyes were opened by a single
cup of expertly crafted cappuccino made with freshly roasted Kona coffee beans,
and I was immediately converted into a pretentious coffee snob. Now I scoff at
weak coffee and evangelize my friends as to the merits of quality espresso. But
how could I not boast in single-origin, fair-trade, handcrafted, seven dollar
lattes when they tasted so much <i>better </i>than the gas station swill that
used to satisfy me?</p><p>Conversion—the supernatural
act by which the Holy Spirit makes you come alive to the beauty of Jesus so
that you embrace him as your Savior—is nothing more or less than a sight of
superior glory that makes what you used to live for taste like gas station
coffee by comparison. 2 Corinthians 4:4 says that before conversion, Satan’s
main agenda in your life was to keep you from seeing Jesus as he really is.
“The god of this world [Satan] has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep
them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.” The reason
that Satan is so hell-bent on keeping people from <i>seeing </i>is simple: if
your soul could catch a real glimpse of him, every chain that the world, the
flesh, and the devil could put on you would not be able to stand in the way of
you pursuing more of him. That’s how God has designed the human heart to
operate: we are always irresistibly drawn to what we have experienced as best
until allured by something better. Not even Satan can override that fundamental
rule of human nature, and so the best he can do is to try everything in his
power to keep you from seeing in the first place.</p><p>Once the blinders have been
removed by the omnipotent power of God himself (2 Corinthians 4:6), the whole
rest of the Christian life and every step forward in sanctification is nothing
more or less than the same thing that saved you: striving for a sight of
superior glory. To see Jesus as more desirable than whatever else is tempting
me, to be more enamored with his love than I am with the latest gadget, to long
to experience and see him more deeply whatever the cost, is the beating heart
of the Christian life and the foundation for freedom from worldliness. In 2
Corinthians 3:18 we are given a simple yet profound recipe for spiritual
transformation: “And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the
Lord, are being transformed into the same image, from one degree of glory to
another. For this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.” Beholding is
becoming; the glory that draws our attention is what we will pursue and become
more like. </p><p>And where is the place that
the glory and grace of Jesus shines the brightest? The answer is, the cross. At
the cross we see his tender love, stooping servanthood, bleeding humility,
flaming holiness, and peerless worth most clearly. So the strategy for freedom
from worldliness is clear: make war on the worldliness in your heart by <i>surveying
the wondrous cross. </i></p><p>SURVEYING A SUPERIOR GLORY</p><p>In 1707, Isaac Watts wrote
one of the most famous hymns of the English language, “When I Survey the
Wondrous Cross.” He based the hymn on Galatians 6:14, the key text to disarming
worldliness. In this hymn, Isaac Watts points us to the ultimate defeat of
worldliness in the believing heart: surveying the wondrous cross, from which a
glory so superior shines, that every worldly gain is seen as loss and every
charming object is seen as vain and empty by comparison. There are five verses
to this song, and each one builds on the preceding verse, laying a gospel
foundation for freedom from worldliness.</p><p>When I survey the wondrous cross</p><p>On which the Prince of glory died,</p><p>My richest gain I count but loss,</p><p>And pour contempt on all my pride.</p><p>The first verse of the hymn
lays out the central thesis of the song, and the motivating power behind all of
the Christian life: “When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of
glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my
pride.” Nothing but surveying “the wondrous cross” in all its multifaceted
glory could be enough to make every gain look like loss by comparison. The
exceeding value of the Prince of glory only highlights the enormity of the
cross and the preciousness of his sacrifice: he is doing it for me! Every
treasure we hold dear can not hold a candle to the great worth of this Prince
of glory, who loved me and gave himself for me. How could we not press in with
all our hearts to know this great Savior better?</p><p>Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast</p><p>Save in the death of Christ my God!</p><p>All the vain things that charm me most,</p><p>I sacrifice them to His blood.</p><p>The second verse is the
response to surveying the wondrous cross: “Forbid it, Lord, that I should
boast, except in the death of Christ my God!” Let my only joy, my only boast,
my only glory, be in this truth: that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, laid down
his life for me. Jeremiah 9:23-24 puts it this way: “Let not the wise man boast
in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man
boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands
and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice, and
righteousness in the earth.” Let our boasts be, “I know the God whose steadfast
love paid the price of his justice in order to clothe me with his perfect
righteousness!” </p><p>In response to this
unfathomable, glorious love comes the second part of my response: “All the vain
things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood.” This isn’t a
sacrifice that is trying to earn something more from God; it’s my meager
offering made in response to his perfect, final offering. This is the act of
dethroning the “desire for other things” from the throne of my heart and
reinstalling Jesus as my rightful King and Center. This is the act of laying
down every one of my desires, all my dreams, and every possession and
longing—even good ones—at the foot of the cross and seeing them as what they
really are: vain, empty things that “charm” me but can never satisfy. In
exchange for these empty treasures, I find at the cross enough glory to fully
satisfy my soul forever.</p><p>See from His head, His hands, His feet,</p><p>Sorrow and love flow mingled down!</p><p>Did ever such love and sorrow meet,</p><p>Or thorns compose so rich a crown?</p><p>The third verse is the
heart of the song, slowing down long enough for us to learn what, exactly, it
means to “survey the wondrous cross.” It means to linger long enough to let the
sight affect you, move you, break you, and bring you to your knees. See from
the Savior’s head, infinitely precious blood flowing from the mocking crown of
thorns—and see your own mockery and cynicism in the thorns that pierced him.
See the Savior’s hands pierced through by more than nails; look again and see
the weight of sin and resolve of love that held him there when he could have
summoned legions of angels to his rescue if he had wished. Marvel that the
hands that formed worlds and stars and hold together the universe (Colossians
1:17) still bear the scars of your rebellion and his rescue. And wonder that
your own guilty name is written in those wounds with indelible, pardoning
blood; hear the Savior say to you, “I will not forget you; behold, I have
engraved you on the palms of my hands” (Isaiah 49:15-16). Ponder the sorrow of
sin, Jesus’ bitter weeping in the garden as he contemplated drinking the cup of
wrath (Isaiah 51:17), the Savior’s anguished grief when the Father turned his
face away… and consider that this grief was yours, not his, and yet he freely
bore it so that all of your tears might be wiped away forever. “He has borne
our griefs and carried our sorrows.” This is the richest of all crowns, more
precious than gold, the highest possible praise to heap on King Jesus: he bled
and wept and died for me. </p><p>His dying crimson, like a robe,</p><p>Spreads o’er His body on the tree;</p><p>Then I am dead to all the globe</p><p>And all the globe is dead to me</p><p>The fourth verse is the
proper response to seeing the great love and sorrow of the Savior, the death of
worldliness in the death of Jesus. As I see my sin executed in the person of my
substitute, the punishment I deserve falling on him, “his dying crimson” blood
buying my costly pardon, the clear sight of such love and sorrow, I realize
that this is the highest, best glory that there is to see. Nothing could be
sweeter, nothing could be deeper, nothing could be brighter, than the sweetness
and depth and brightness of this amazing grace. This is the taste of joy that
ruins me for every other lesser sweetness, the depth of mercy that exposes
every other shallow thrill for what it really is, the brilliance of glory that
outshines every other feeble worldly candle. That’s what it means to be
crucified to the world; it is dead to me, and I am unresponsive to its
allurements, caught up in a greater thrill than it could possibly offer. “Then
you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and exult” (Isaiah 60:5).</p><p>Were the whole realm of nature mine,</p><p>That would be an offering far too small;</p><p>Love so amazing, so divine,</p><p>Demands my soul, my life, my all!</p><p>The hymn ends with the
reoriented worldview of the ransomed, ravished heart: everything in the world,
every trinket, toy, and treasure, exists to be an offering of love to the One
who first offered himself in love for me. Those two lines, “Were the whole
realm of nature mine, that would be an offering far too small!” captures the
change of heart when Jesus replaces worldly treasures as the center of the
solar system. Instead of the world being a temptation to idolatry and a
distraction from kingdom pursuits, it is placed back into its proper orbit and
becomes what it was created to be: a springboard to worship. Every material
blessing I have is a gift of his grace, to be received with thankfulness and
used in his service. Every gift and ability I have exists not for my praise but
his. How could it be any other way, when he has done so much for me? Such
amazing love demands, deserves, and daily lays claim on my soul, my life, my
all. To the heart that has tasted the goodness of knowing a crucified Savior,
such a demand is not duty but the highest possible delight: living in pursuit
of him who died for me. Could there be any greater joy?</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Oh Lord, I confess that my heart is all too often cold toward you.
Even when I sing songs like, “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross,” I don’t feel
the wonder, I don’t sense the joy, that I know I should. Forgive my stubborn
heart, and bend me to your Word. Open my eyes and fill me with your Spirit as I
behold Jesus in the gospel, until I am moved by what I see.</i></p></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 data-reactid="30"><a data-reactid="31">The World, The Flesh, and the Devil</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="35"></div></section></div></div>
